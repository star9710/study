        我最强烈的记忆不是一段记忆。它是我想象出来的，之后回忆起来就像真的发生过一样。记忆成形于我五岁时，就要满六岁前，源自我父亲讲的一个故事，他讲得那么详细，以至于我和哥哥姐姐们都各自演绎出自己的电影版本，其中充斥着枪林弹雨和喊叫声。我的版本里有蟋蟀。当我的家人在厨房里挤作一团，灯关着，躲避将房子包围的联邦调查局人员时，那就是我听到的声音。一个女人伸手去够一杯水，月光映照出她的轮廓。一声枪响，像鞭子抽打的声音，她倒下了。在我的记忆中，倒下的总是母亲，她怀里还抱着一个婴儿。

        My strongest memory is not a memory. I imagined it and then looked back on it as if it had really happened. The memories formed when I was five, just before I turned six, from a story my father told in such detail that my brothers and sisters and I each developed our own version of a movie, full of bullets and shouts. My version has crickets in it. That's what I hear as my family huddle in the kitchen with the lights off, hiding from the FBI agents surrounding the house. A woman reached for a glass of water, silhouetted by moonlight. There was a shot, like the crack of a whip, and she fell. In my memory, it was always the mother who fell, with a baby in her arms.</p>
